position RIS: PR: make sure it's a little bit outside of room area (-5.01. ...)

x_grid, y_grid = room space (-5, 5)

grid_size (keep small for accuracy (final evaluation) (0.5)), during optimization can make big (1)
grid leads to heatmap (PEB), calculated in main loop

channel matrix contains interesting information


input: PB PR (position of PB and PR), later (OB, OR) (orientation)
    Discretize possible (orientation and position)

the PEB_cell (or PEB_Mat later) is what we optimize


Objective functoin:
    get CDF for error grid
    Find the x-value (error) where 90% of the error is reached (y)

Optimization:
    Can set K to lower (e.g. 8 instead of 64), overall pattern will be the same
    Can paralleise main loop of heatmap calculation
